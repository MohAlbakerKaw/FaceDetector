# FaceDetector
The purpose of this code is to test the SageMaker studio lab.

We are trying to build a deep model to recognize faces. 

The dataset will be stricted.

Interesting approaches to be utilized to make the approach functional.

Data augmentation is going to increase the images in our dataset.

Transfer learning is going to provide us with a trained model to recognize faces to build upon.
